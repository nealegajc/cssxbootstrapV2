            For a tragically brief time, Pittsburgh-based rapper and producer Mac Miller connected with legions of listeners through the appeal of both his curious, jazz-flecked instrumental style and heartfelt lyrics that laid bare his struggles with depression and addiction. Though his 2011 studio album debut Blue Slide Park topped the charts, his style and lyrical focus changed on subsequent, more personal releases like 2016's The Divine Feminine, which dominated the R&B and rap charts. Miller followed up with Swimming in 2018, but he died from an overdose one month after the album's release. His early output had an immediate resurgence as longtime fans mourned and those who just learned about the rapper explored his work for the first time. Posthumous releases followed Miller's death, such as 2020's Circles, and the 2025 release of "lost album" Balloonerism.
